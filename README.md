# Alertify – Women Safety App

Alertify is a **simple and fast women safety web application** designed to be used during **high-pressure emergency situations**. The application focuses on **speed, clarity, and ease of use** rather than a complex interface.

## Key Idea

In panic situations, users may not have the time or mental clarity to navigate through multiple screens. Hence, Alertify is intentionally built with a **minimal UI containing a single emergency button**.

## How It Works

* The app contains **one main emergency button**
* When the button is clicked:

  * The user’s **live location** is captured
  * An **alert message along with the location link** is sent to **predefined trusted contacts**

This ensures **quick action with zero confusion** during emergencies.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Structure
* **CSS** – Styling
* **JavaScript** – Logic and location handling
* **ReactJS** – Component-based frontend
* **API's** - Geolocation API, WhatsApp API, Leaflet

## Future Enhancements

* SMS / WhatsApp alert integration
* Real-time backend using Firebase / Node.js
* User authentication and contact management
* Continuous location tracking

## Project Purpose

This project was built to demonstrate:

* Practical problem-solving
* User-centric UI/UX design
* Real-world safety application development
