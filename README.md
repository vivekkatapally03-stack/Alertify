## 🚨 Alertify – Women Safety App

Alertify is a **simple and fast women safety web application** designed to be used during **high-pressure emergency situations**. The application focuses on **speed, clarity, and ease of use** rather than a complex interface.

---

##  💡 Key Idea

In panic situations, users may not have the time or mental clarity to navigate through multiple screens. Hence, Alertify is intentionally built with a **minimal UI containing a single emergency button**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works 

* The app contains **Help Me** button.
* When the button is clicked:

  * The user’s **live location** is captured 📍
  * An **alert message along with the location link** is sent to **predefined trusted contacts** 📩

This ensures **quick action with zero confusion** during emergencies.
